                                A yearning for transmission. The Louis Vuitton Spring-Summer 2022 Women's Collection is an invitation to the le grand bal of time.<br /> Time itself is not that important. At the same time, time is everything. Time deconstructs function and meaning, uniting costumes.<br /> The day turns into night, and the simple clothes transform into luxury. Right now, from yesterday to today, clothes play their role as messengers.<br /> The experience of wearing clothes and the voice handed down. Being one step ahead at the forefront of the countdown is a mix of ever-changing and creative.
